## Trik

Somchai visits a fair where a magician performs a trick involving three opaque cups and a ball. The cups are placed in a row, and initially the ball is under the leftmost cup. The magician repeatedly swaps two cups at a time very quickly, but the audience can still see which pair of cups is being swapped.

Since Somchai is a programmer, he encodes each swap using the letters **A**, **B**, and **C**, as shown in the figure above.

Your task is to write a program that reads this sequence of swaps and determines the final position of the ball.

### Input  
A single line containing a string of at most 50 characters, consisting only of the letters **A**, **B**, and **C**.

---

### Output  
Print a single integer:  
- `1` if the ball is in the leftmost cup  
- `2` if the ball is in the middle cup  
- `3` if the ball is in the rightmost cup
