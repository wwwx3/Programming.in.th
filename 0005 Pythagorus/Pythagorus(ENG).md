A right triangle has one interior angle equal to (90^\circ). The side opposite the right angle is called the **hypotenuse**, which is the longest side of the triangle. The other two sides are the **legs**.

According to the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the squares of the two legs equals the square of the hypotenuse.

Given the lengths of the two legs, compute the length of the hypotenuse.
