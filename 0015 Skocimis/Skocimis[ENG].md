Three kangaroos are playing on a number line (integers). Initially, they stand on three different integer positions.

In one move, one kangaroo jumps to an empty integer position that lies strictly between the other two kangaroos. No two kangaroos are ever allowed to occupy the same position.

Given the starting positions of the three kangaroos, determine the maximum number of moves possible before the game ends (no more valid moves).

### Input

\[
0 < A < B < C < 100
\]
representing the starting positions of the kangaroos.
