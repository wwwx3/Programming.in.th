Let (S) be the average of two integers $(X_1)$ and $(X_2)$, defined as
$$[
S = \frac{X_1 + X_2}{2}
]$$
Somchai gave Preeda two gifts with values $(X_1)$ and $(X_2)$. Preeda calculated the average value (S), which is also an integer, but then lost the value of the second gift (X_2).

Write a program to determine $(X_2)$.
